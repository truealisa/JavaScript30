    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // REFERENCE TO `PLAYERS`
    const team0 = players;

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    // COPY OF `PLAYERS`
    const team1 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team2 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team3 = [...players];

    const team4 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Alisa',
      age: 24,
      social: {
        fb: 'truealisa',
        email: 'truealisa@gmail.com'
      }
    }

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const newPerson = Object.assign({}, person, { height: 1.85, age: 33 });

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    // DEEP COPYING
    const newestPerson = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
